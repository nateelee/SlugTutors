If you are a tutor, you need to specify which classes you can tutor. 
If you click on one such class, you should see all the list of people  that have expressed interest in being tutored by you for that class.  And somehow, you should be able to message them. 
Contacts can be either active (the people currently interested) or archived (no longer interested).

When tutor A is in class C, and clicks on student B, A should see the thread of messages sent/received with B.
